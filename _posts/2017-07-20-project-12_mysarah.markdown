description: mySARAH is a website allowing sufferers of rheumatoid arthritis to personally follow the Strengthening And Stretching For Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Hand (SARAH) programme. Tim, lead programmer of Cranston IT, created the mySARAH website as part of his day job in the Oxford Clinical Trial Research Unit. The website provides participants with a responsive and interactive website to follow the 12 week SARAH programme. The website also allows the SARAH team to easily update content and view participants progress through the programme.
