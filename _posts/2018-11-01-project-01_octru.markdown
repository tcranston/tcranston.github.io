description: Idfac Ltd offers high quality consultancy advice to people developing novel therapies and technologies in the life science and healthcare sectors. Idfac Ltd, then a newly created business, required a simple website and mailbox. Using Google Apps, we created a neat, simple website that can be updated 'live' from the website. We also configured bespoke idfac.com mailboxes in Google Apps for each director. The end result was a smart web presences for a newly formed business.
